# Sales & Customer Dashboard Project

## Introduction
This project showcases a comprehensive approach to analyzing and visualizing sales and customer performance data using Tableau. The project includes two interconnected dashboards: the **Sales Dashboard** and the **Customer Dashboard**, each designed to meet specific user requirements for sales performance and customer analysis.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide stakeholders, including sales managers and executives, with actionable insights into sales trends and customer behaviors. The dashboards are designed with flexibility, interactivity, and clarity in mind, ensuring that users can easily navigate and filter the data to meet their needs.

## User Requirements

### Sales Dashboard

#### Dashboard Purpose
The Sales Dashboard aims to present an overview of sales metrics and trends, enabling users to analyze year-over-year sales performance and identify key trends.

#### Key Features
- **KPI Overview:**
  - Displays a summary of total sales, profits, and quantity for the current and previous years.
  
- **Sales Trends:**
  - Presents data for each KPI on a monthly basis, comparing the current year with the previous year.
  - Highlights months with the highest and lowest sales for easy recognition.

- **Product Subcategory Comparison:**
  - Compares sales performance across different product subcategories for both years.
  - Includes a comparison of sales with profit margins.

- **Weekly Sales & Profit Trends:**
  - Displays weekly sales and profit data for the current year.
  - Shows average weekly values and highlights weeks that are above or below average.

### Customer Dashboard

#### Dashboard Purpose
The Customer Dashboard provides an overview of customer data, trends, and behaviors. It helps marketing teams and management understand customer segments and improve customer satisfaction.

#### Key Features
- **KPI Overview:**
  - Displays a summary of the total number of customers, total sales per customer, and the total number of orders for both the current and previous years.
  
- **Customer Trends:**
  - Presents monthly data for each KPI, comparing the current year with the previous year.
  - Highlights months with the highest and lowest customer-related metrics.

- **Customer Distribution by Number of Orders:**
  - Represents the distribution of customers based on the number of orders placed, providing insights into customer behavior, loyalty, and engagement.

- **Top 10 Customers by Profit:**
  - Lists the top 10 customers who have generated the highest profits, including details like rank, number of orders, current sales, profit, and the last order date.

## Design & Interactivity

### Dashboard Design
To meet the design requirements, I created mockups for the **Sales Dashboard** and **Customer Dashboard** to visualize the layout and key elements:
- **Sales & Customer Mockup**: This mockup was used to plan the visual structure of both dashboards, ensuring that all required elements are appropriately placed and visually coherent.
- **Container Mockup**: This mockup outlines the container structure used in the dashboards, with vertical and horizontal containers ensuring a flexible and organized layout.

### Interactivity
The dashboards are designed with user interactivity in mind:
- **Dynamic Year Selection**: Users can select any desired year to view historical data.
- **Easy Navigation**: Users can seamlessly navigate between the Sales and Customer dashboards using interactive icons.
- **Interactive Charts**: The dashboards allow users to filter data directly through the charts, enhancing the data exploration experience.

### Data Filters
Users can filter data by product information (category and subcategory) and location information (region, state, city) to gain specific insights relevant to their needs.
